# Virtual Library Management System

## Overview
The **Virtual Library Management System (VLMS)** is a console-based application developed in C++ to demonstrate fundamental object-oriented programming principles. It provides basic functionalities for managing a library's book inventory and member records through the command line interface.

## Features

- **Book Management**
  - Add new books to the inventory.
  - View details of existing books.
  - Delete books from the inventory.

- **Member Management**
  - Register new library members.
  - View member information.
  - Remove members from the system.

- **Borrowing System**
  - Record book borrowings by members.
  - Track return dates for borrowed books.

## Installation and Compilation

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
   - C++ Compiler: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC) that supports C++11 or later standards.

2. **Compilation Steps**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the source code files.
   - Compile the code using the following command:

     ```bash
     g++ -std=c++11 -o vlms main.cpp
     ```

     Replace `main.cpp` with the actual name of your source file if different.

## Usage

1. **Running the Application**
   - After successful compilation, execute the program:

     ```bash
     ./vlms   # On Linux/macOS
     vlms.exe # On Windows
     ```

2. **Interacting with the Application**
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to navigate through the menu options.
   - Input the required information as prompted to manage books and members.
   - Use the appropriate menu options to add, view, or delete records.

## Sample Output
